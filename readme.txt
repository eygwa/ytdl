made this because the youtube to mp3 websites online have sucked for like 5 yrs 

all files will be downloaded to this folder
mp3 downloads can take a few seconds due ffmpeg conversion

when you download something, it will create an outputs directory wherever ur current working directory is and just send shit there

sources should be cited within the code

requirements :
python      [made on 3.12]

pytube      [pip install pytube]
pathlib     [pip install pathlib]
tkinter     [pip install tkinter]
        or  [pip install PySimpleGUI] (i think its bundled in simplegui)

ffmpeg	    [https://phoenixnap.com/kb/ffmpeg-windows]

future plans r to just make the ui less terrible and make it run better

once you have all the dependencies downloaded u can jusr run runme.py :P

the console also has some relevant/helpful outputs so feel free to look there as u go
